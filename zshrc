# Fancy cd'ing
#   Installation:
#       Put something like this in your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.zshrc:
#
#              . /path/to/z.sh
#
#       cd around for a while to build up the db.
#
#       PROFIT!!
#
#       Optionally:
#              Set $_Z_CMD to change the command name (default z).
#              Set $_Z_DATA to change the datafile (default $HOME/.z).
#              Set $_Z_NO_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS to prevent symlink resolution.
#              Set $_Z_NO_PROMPT_COMMAND to handle PROMPT_COMMAND/precmd  your-
#              self.
#              Set $_Z_EXCLUDE_DIRS to an array of directory trees to  exclude.
#              Set $_Z_OWNER to allow usage when in 'sudo -s' mode.
#              (These  settings  should  go  in  .bashrc/.zshrc before the line
#              added above.)
#              Install the provided man page z.1  somewhere  in  your  MANPATH,
